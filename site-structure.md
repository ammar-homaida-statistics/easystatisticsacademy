# EasyStatisticsAcademy — General Site Structure (Master Level)

This file defines the permanent, top-level structure of EasyStatisticsAcademy.
All future content must belong to exactly one of these sections.

This structure is intentionally general and stable.
Subsections, lessons, and tools will be added later under each section.

## Rule (Non-Negotiable)
- This file defines the knowledge map of the site.
- No page is created without belonging to one section.
- Sections do NOT change names.
- Growth happens only inside sections.

This guarantees long-term clarity and academic integrity.
