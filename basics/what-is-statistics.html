  <h1>What is Statistics?</h1>

  <p>
    Statistics is the science of learning from data. It provides methods to collect data, summarize it,
    and draw reliable conclusions under uncertainty.
  </p>

  <h2>Why do we need statistics?</h2>
  <p>
    In real life, we rarely see the full truth. We see samples, partial information, and noisy measurements.
    Statistics helps us make decisions using evidence rather than intuition alone.
  </p>

  <h2>Two major parts of statistics</h2>
  <h3>1) Descriptive statistics</h3>
  <p>
    Descriptive statistics summarizes data. Examples include averages, percentages, charts, and measures of spread
    such as the standard deviation.
  </p>

  <h3>2) Inferential statistics</h3>
  <p>
    Inferential statistics uses a sample to make conclusions about a larger population. Examples include confidence
    intervals, hypothesis testing, and regression models.
  </p>

  <h2>Key words you will see often</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Population:</strong> the full group you care about (e.g., all patients in a hospital).</li>
    <li><strong>Sample:</strong> the observed part of the population (e.g., 200 patients).</li>
    <li><strong>Variable:</strong> a measured property (e.g., age, blood pressure, income).</li>
    <li><strong>Parameter:</strong> a true population value (usually unknown), like the real mean.</li>
    <li><strong>Statistic:</strong> a sample-based value, like the sample mean.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Simple real-world examples</h2>
  <h3>Example A: Surveys</h3>
  <p>
    You want to know what percentage of students are satisfied with a course. You cannot ask everyone, so you take a
    sample and estimate the percentage, including uncertainty.
  </p>

  <h3>Example B: Medical research</h3>
  <p>
    You compare two treatments and ask: is the difference real, or could it be random variation? Statistics provides
    the framework to answer this scientifically.
  </p>

  <h3>Example C: Business decisions</h3>
  <p>
    A company tests two marketing messages. Data shows one performs better, but statistics helps confirm whether the
    improvement is meaningful or just noise.
